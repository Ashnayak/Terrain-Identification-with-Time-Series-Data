# Terrain-Identification-with-Time-Series-Data

The objective of this project is to investigate the inertial data captured by an accelerometer and gyroscope attached to prosthetic lower limbs. The intent is to develop a terrain identification system without visual data. We implemented a Random Forest model to identify the different types of terrain based on time series data.
